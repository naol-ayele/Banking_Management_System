# 🤖 AI Sidebar Assistant for Banking Management System

## 📌 Overview
The AI Sidebar Assistant is integrated into the **Banking Management System** as a 
collapsible **sidebar assistant** in the frontend. 

It provides **role-based functionalities** for:
- Customers
- Staff
- Admins

The AI agent does **not** connect directly to the database.  
Instead, it communicates **indirectly** through the **Spring Boot backend**, which handles
all business logic and database access.

The assistant supports:
- Conversational queries
- Loan eligibility predictions
- Personalized financial insights
- Compliance & fraud detection
- Transaction summaries with **matplotlib visualizations**
- **Financial analysis & predictions using Logistic Regression, Pandas, and NumPy**

## 🏗️ System Architecture
- **Frontend**:
  - Streamlit (for testing)
  - React (for production)

- **AI Assistant**:
  - Sidebar popup component
  - Conversational + visual responses
  - RAG-based responses for FAQs & policy documents (PDFs)
  - Financial analysis with:
    - **Logistic Regression** → loan eligibility, risk prediction
    - **Pandas** → data preprocessing & analysis
    - **NumPy** → numerical computations

- **Backend**:
  - Spring Boot framework
  - Encapsulates all DB access and business logic
  - Exposes REST APIs for AI assistant

- **Database**:
  - Centralized banking system DB (customers, transactions, loans, staff, admin data)

## 🚀 Development Roadmap
1. Prototype AI sidebar with Streamlit
2. Implement backend APIs in Spring Boot:
   - `/api/customer_ai`
   - `/api/staff_ai`
   - `/api/admin_ai`
3. Connect AI assistant to backend APIs
4. Migrate to React frontend for production
5. Add advanced features (fraud detection, predictive insights)

## 📎 Notes
- All user interactions are role-based
- AI assistant will adapt responses according to logged-in user role
- Compliance & audit logs must be maintained for all AI-assisted actions
